# Rocky and Ocean Worlds' Structure (ROWS) model

The Rocky and Ocean Worldsâ€™ Structure (ROWS) model is a one-dimensional Python tool for modeling the internal structure of rocky planetary bodies.

Based on a small set of user-defined parameters (planetary mass, iron content, and water content), the model provides estimations of planetary radius and the distribution of internal properties. It computes radial profiles of depth-dependent characteristics including: density, pressure, gravity, temperature, heat capacity, electrical conductivity, seismic velocities, bulk and shear modulus. The model can represent planets differentiated into a metallic core, silicate mantle, liquid water, or ice layers. Users may also adjust parameters such as core composition, crustal thickness, and lithosphere properties to explore a wide range of planetary scenarios.

For a detailed description and tutorial, please refer to ROWS_model_Documentation.pdf.

Instructions for setup, execution, and usage are provided in the manual, specifically Section 2: 'Running the Code'.
